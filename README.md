# IOS 1. Project
## Overview
Shell script aimed at filtering csv files.

This script filters and prints statistics of files with covid patients.

## Running syntax
```./corona [-h] [FILTERS] [COMMMAND] [LOG [LOG2 [...]]```

```-h``` Prints help

Rest of the important stuff is in the script help. Too lazy to rewrite it
